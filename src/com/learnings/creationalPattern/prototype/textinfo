Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.



The Prototype pattern delegates the cloning process to the actual objects that are being cloned. 
The pattern declares a common interface for all objects that support cloning. 
This interface lets you clone an object without coupling your code to the class of that object. 
Usually, such an interface contains just a single clone method.


Prototype design pattern is used when the Object creation is a costly affair and requires a lot of time and resources and you have a similar object already existing.

Prototype pattern provides a mechanism to copy the original object to a new object and then modify it according to our needs.
 Prototype design pattern uses java cloning to copy the objec
