Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

 You avoid tight coupling between concrete products and client code.
 Single Responsibility Principle. You can extract the product creation code into one place, making the code easier to support.
  Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new variants of products without breaking existing client code.
