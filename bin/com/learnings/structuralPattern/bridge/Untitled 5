Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely
 related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.
 
 
 Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently
 The implementation of bridge design pattern follows the notion to prefer Composition over inheritance.
